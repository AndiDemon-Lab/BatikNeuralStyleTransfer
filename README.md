# Batik Neural Style Transfer

A deep learning project that applies neural style transfer techniques to create unique batik-inspired artwork.

## Overview

This project combines traditional Indonesian batik patterns with modern neural style transfer algorithms to generate new artistic designs. It uses deep learning to extract and transfer the distinctive style elements of batik onto various content images.

## Features

- Neural style transfer implementation for batik patterns
- Support for multiple batik styles and content images
- Customizable style transfer parameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pillow
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BatikNeuralStyleTransfer.git
cd BatikNeuralStyleTransfer
pip install -r requirements.txt
